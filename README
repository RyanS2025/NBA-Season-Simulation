How to use the basketball simulation:
    1. Each possesion is determined by the number of minutes. 1 minute = 1 possesion
    2. Touches Tendency: How often a player will have the ball per possesion. 
    3. Shot Tendency: How often a player will shoot the ball if they have it
    4. Assist Tendency: How often a player will pass the ball (and assist)
    5. Three Point Tendency: How often a shot will be a three pointer

    Note: Tendencies will effect eachother! For example, a high assist tendency and high shot tendency will not 
    generate both high shots and high assists, it will generate less because of limited possesions.
